# TEJ4M-Scribe

This is my project for the TEJ4M course. It's a robot that can draw on whiteboard by suspending itself using two strings.

You can find the code for the Arduino Nano and ESP-32 microcontrollers in the `arduino` and `esp32` respectively.  
The other folders are tests and proofs of concept that I made during the development of the project.
